# Hello World
This is my home page! My name is Damien Mota and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 8
Lab 8, Part 3 was a favorite because it's related to art. I learned how to use Chrono to make ASCII animations. I also learned how to use miliseconds in order to delay the animation so it would play smoothly on my computer. It was nice to make art in code and see what else I could do with programs besides numbers.

* Lab 10 
Lab 10, Part 3 was a favorite because it's creating an image in code. I learned how to make colored images and how to merge them to make a gradient. This was fun because once again it was going into the world of art which was something I wanted to do before coming into computer science. It made me feel good that I was able to so easily collide both of these worlds together.

* Lab 12
Lab 12, Part 1 was a favorite because it's creating a gif. I learned how sine created moving images. This was amazing to learn because I didn't even know that something like this was possible. I always wondered how precalculus related to computer science and now I know because of this project. I hope to use more math in coding that can create something as cool as a gif. It was fascinating to use math in coding.
