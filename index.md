### CPSC 120

* Lab 8
Lab 8, Part 3 was a favorite because it's related to art. I learned how to use Chrono to make ASCII animations. It was nice to make art in code.

* Lab 10 
Lab 10, Part 3 was a favorite because it's creating an image in code. I learned how to make colored images and how to merge them to make a gradient.

* Lab 12
Lab 12, Part 1 was a favorite because it's creating a gif. I learned how sine created moving images. It was fascinating to use math in coding.
